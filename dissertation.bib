	title = {Consent management on the Ethereum Blockchain},
	abstract = {Exchanging personal information for access to a service has
	            become an integral part of everyday life. Surprisingly often,
	            we do not even realize that this exchange is taking place.
	            When accepting the terms of service agreement of a company,
	            it is often unclear what is happening to (personal) data.
	            Unknowingly, users had out blank cheques to companies,
	            allowing them to control and resell the their data. The
	            General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became
	            enforceable in May 2018, is a first step towards putting
	            users back in control of their personal data. With these new
	            regulations, the existing solutions for consent management
	            are not feasible any more for a data marketplace as well as
	            for most consent scenarios. Utilizing the Design Science
	            Research (DSR) methodology, this master thesis aims to create
	            a prototype of a consent management system on the Ethereum
	            Blockchain. With this prototype, we envision a data
	            marketplace scenario which enables users to control their
	            data.},
